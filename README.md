# Automated Inventory Management System

This project implements an **Automated Inventory Management System** designed for warehouse management using **RFID technology**. The system ensures real-time tracking, reduces human errors, and improves operational efficiency.

## Features
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Accurate product identification and quantity estimation
- Enhanced operational efficiency with automated processes
- User-friendly interface for inventory monitoring
- Integration of hardware and software components

## Hardware Components
- **RFID Module V3**: For RFID tag scanning.
- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller for wireless communication.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For fill-level or presence detection.
- **DC-DC Buck Converter**: Voltage regulation.
- **Li-Po Battery**: Power supply.
- **Matrix Board and Jumper Wires**: For assembling circuits.

## Software Components
- **Arduino IDE**: Programming the ESP8266 and RFID module.
- **Django Framework**: Backend development.
- **Sqlite3**: Database management.
- **Frontend Framework**: React or HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into three layers:
1. **Hardware Layer**:
   - RFID tags and readers for data capture.
   - Microcontroller (ESP8266) for transmitting data to the server.
   - Ultrasonic sensors for additional presence detection.

2. **Middleware Layer**:
   - Wi-Fi communication between the ESP8266 and backend server.
   - Processing and storing data in the database.

3. **Application Layer**:
   - Backend APIs for processing inventory data.
   - Frontend for inventory management and reporting.

## Circuit Connection
Proper circuit connections are essential for the system's functionality. Ensure the hardware components, such as the RFID module, ESP8266, and sensors, are correctly connected based on their pin specifications. Refer to the component datasheets for detailed connection instructions.

## Installation Steps
### Hardware Setup
1. Assemble the RFID reader, ESP8266, ultrasonic sensors, and other components.
2. Ensure proper circuit connections as per the component requirements.
3. Test the hardware connections using Arduino sketches.

### Software Setup
1. Install the required libraries:
   - `Adafruit_PN532` for RFID communication.
   - `ESP8266WiFi` for Wi-Fi communication.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   ```
3. Setup the backend server:
   - Install Django and MySQL.
   - Create the database schema for inventory.
   - Run the Django server.
4. Setup the frontend:
   - Use React or a basic HTML/CSS template.
   - Connect the frontend to the backend APIs.

## Usage
1. Scan an RFID tag to add or remove inventory.
2. Monitor inventory levels through the frontend dashboard.
3. Use real-time alerts for stockouts or overstocking.

## Testing
- Test RFID tag reading using sample Arduino sketches.
- Verify database updates after scanning.
- Check the frontend dashboard for real-time updates.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for retail-level management.
- Implement advanced analytics for inventory forecasting.
- Integrate weight sensors for better product quantity estimation.
